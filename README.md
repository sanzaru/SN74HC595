# SNx4HC595 C++ library
Library for controlling a SNx4HC595 shift register via the wiringPi library in C++
The code is written for usage on the RaspberryPi, but it should be easy to port it to the Arduino.

This library provides functionality to act with a SNx4HC595 chip (e.g. SN74HC595).
Any chip of the series should work.

## Requirements
* wiringPi library
* C++ compiler

## Tested chips
* SN74HC595
